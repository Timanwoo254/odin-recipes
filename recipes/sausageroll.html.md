        <h2> Description </h2> <p>Spicy seasoned sausage mixed with cream cheese and wrapped in crescent rolls. For a different variation, add thin slices of pepperoni on the bottom of crescent roll before the sausage mixture and shred cheddar on top of sausage; roll pastry over.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul> <li>1 pound fresh, ground spicy pork sausage,</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls</li>
            <li>1 egg white, lightly beaten</li>

                  <li>In a medium skillet, lightly brown sausage and drain. While sausage is still hot, add cream cheese and stir until cheese is melted and mixture is creamy. Cool completely.</li>
