        <body> <h1>Black raspberry sorbet</h1>
          <h2>Description</h2> <p>An easy summer treat! We love making this from the black raspberries that grow in our backyard. For garnish, we use mint and pansies grown from seed. You can buy edible flowers from the grocery store, or grow your own, but don't use plants from nurseries that have been treated with pesticides.</p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3> <ul> <li>¾ cup slightly warm water</li>
                                    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                                    <li>1 tablespoon creme de cassis liqueur</li>
                                    <li>4 cups black raspberries</li>
                                    <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                                    <li>2 egg whites</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h4>Steps</h4> <ol> <li>Combine water, sugar, and creme de cassis in a medium bowl. Stir until sugar granules are completely dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                                                <li>Combine berries and lemon juice in a blender; process to a smooth puree.</li>
                                                <li>Set a fine mesh strainer over a medium bowl. Pour small batches of the berry puree into the strainer, stirring vigorously to force the liquid into the bowl. Discard the seeds once most of the liquid has been removed.</li>
                                                <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until until stiff peaks form. Remove the puree from the freezer and whisk until slushy. Fold egg whites into the puree until just blended. Cover and freeze until solid, about 2 hours.</li>
                                            </ol>
